# Lunch time day 1 - sticky notes
## Up
- Interesting concepts I have not heard before
- All great. Nice to hear formal terms for teaching techniques
- Well paced and clear +1 +1
- Like the workshop so far
- Memory test was enlightening exercise
- Easy to follow slides
- Online document was great
- Opportunities to rethink about basic teaching errors, which are often overlooked
- Very clear
- Use reading other people's examples/ideas on shared doc
- Lots of practical exercises +1
- Good balance of lecture and exercises
- Language bits like "this should be achievable" and "what questions do you have?"
- Pedagogy models used familiar to me, and easy to understand for those less familiar


## Down
- Coffee was bitter
- Aims of some of the exercises were not clear
- Identify misconceptions example not really needed. More time for writing own MCQ would have been better.
- Expand literature on teaching and learning
- Make clear at the start the differences between teaching SWC workshops, and standard modules
- Only teaching novices is covered - what about teaching more advanced learners?
- Give overview/agenda for whole day
- Collaborative document gets busy during exercises +1
- Slow start
- Fluid representations were difficult
- Label the coffee and hot water
- Human memory oversimplified without any disclaimer

# End of Day 1: one up, one down
## Up
+ interacting with other people
+ range of backgrounds of attendees
+ fun and interactive
+ learn to be a teacher is a good idea
+ how the concepts were explained
+ motivation and demotivation
+ easy to follow slides, lively discussions
+ collaborative document

## Down
- lots of new ideas
- some exercises overlapped in their purpose
- google doc confusing to use
- hard work
- time table slipped a bit
- some aspects were common sense, but in new ways
- home work

# Lunch time day 2: sticky notes
## Positive
- Live coding demos with feedback (*5)
- Two rounds of live coding
- Concept of reverse instructional design
- Learning objectives will help focus development of my own teaching material
- Good exercises and slides content
- Presenting practice (*2)
- Seeing other people's ideas
- Instructors really approachable with questions

## Negative
- 3 mins live coding is difficult out of context of the whole lesson
- Live coding feedback from the instructors would have been nice
- Fast paced
- Would have liked to live-code for longer than 3 mins (*3)
- Make more time to summarise people's comments from the shared document
- Too much time for live coding (group of 2)

# End of Day 2: one up, one down

## Up/positive/went well
Live coding interesting and also how to do official workshops
Liked faded examples
Liked videoed exercises, useful, not seen myself before on screen
All chunks of the course useful
Discussions about prep of workshops, surveys, understanding learners, background
Presentation exercises really good, felt comfortable doing it in front of a small group of people
Trainers presented well, it went smoothly 
Lot of content
Pre-workshop communication was really good

## Down/negative/to improve
Building website exercise could have been done as homework, no point in doing it in class
Instructors to come more down to learners to give feedback, get our level of feedback
Loads of different pages to open, overwhelming
Repeated live coding video maybe not so useful as not much to improve on based on feedback they got - not enough to justify the 2nd exercise
People get tired - shorter sessions, maybe more homework and less class time
More time for practical exercises, especially for new instructors
Exercises very useful, you hear a lot and think a lot but actually hard to handle in real life situations - take more time to do some exercises e.g. 10 minutes for live coding 
Later start time, 10am-4pm, to recognise caring responsibilities and travel time
Least interactive work - how Carpentries work - put that before lunch or first thing in the morning and not after lunch
